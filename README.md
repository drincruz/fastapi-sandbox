# fastapi-sandbox

Sandbox for playing around with FastAPI

## Local Dev

### Setup

#### Set up a new virtual environment (optional)

You will be installing some new Python requirements, so it's recommended to get a virtual environment set up.

```
python -m venv .venv
```

#### Install Requirements

The typical `pip install` will help you get set up.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running fastapi

After installing the requirements, `fastapi` should be available to run in a shell. Run the following to run fastapi in development mode.

```
fastapi dev src/main.py
```
